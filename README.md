Frobel-open-gifts
=======================

Frobel Open Gift is an open source version of the Friedrich Fröbel pedagogical material.
This material is originally pedagogical toy design to teach numeracy and math in Kindergarten.
But they also could be used to study information visualization construction (we used it for this purpose). 

# What is it:

# What we already release:

Froebel original gift are composed of 10 "gifts" (pedagogical toys). 
Over the ten original "gifts" we have just re designed the squared tiles from Gift 7 for a FabLab fabrication.
Two version are accessibles: 
* a 3d printable tile: https://github.com/INRIA/frobel-open-gifts/blob/master/tangible-square-printable-model.stl
* and a laser cuttable frame of tile: 
We also provide the frame to make a container box for the tiles:

# How to Contribute 

* Fork this reporsitory 
* Create your own folder gift folder "Gift-NN"
* Add the frame for cutting or the model for printing, eventually a box design 
* Photography and document your fabrication process 
* and finally make a commit request 

# Our usage 
Frobel Open Gift was made for research purpose to study constructive visualization paradigm. 
More information about constructive visualization could be found on the following research paper : 
* Constructive visualization paradygm http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00978437
* Visualization construction study (coming soon)
